Say for a Docker image build\r\n\r\n## How?\r\n\r\n1. Download the release from the [releases](https://github.com/KensoDev/circleenv/releases) page.\r\n2. execute (refer to the usage section)\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```\r\nNAME:\r\n   circle-env - Circle CI commands\r\n\r\nUSAGE:\r\n   circle-env [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]\r\n\r\nVERSION:\r\n   0.0.3\r\n\r\nCOMMANDS:\r\n   sync, p      Sync Environment Variables to CircleCI\r\n   replace, p   Replace ENV variables in files\r\n   help, h      Shows a list of commands or help for one command\r\n\r\nGLOBAL OPTIONS:\r\n   --help, -h           show help\r\n   --version, -v        print the version\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## `circle-env sync`\r\n\r\nSyncs your `.env` file to the CircleCI project\r\n\r\n* `project-name` your CircleCI project name (eg: `circleenv`)\r\n* `username` Your CircleCI (and github) username (eg: `KensoDev`)\r\n* `token` Your CircleCI API token\r\n\r\nOptional flag is the filename where you store your environment variables. By\r\ndefault it's `.env` in the current working directory (Which is the easiest to\r\nfollow/remember)\r\n\r\n## `circle-env replace`\r\n\r\nScans your current working directory for `.template` files, scans the env variable in them and writes the file, replacing the content.\r\n\r\nThis will turn `database.yml.template` to `database.yml` with the variables replaces from env variables.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2016 Avi Tzurel\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
